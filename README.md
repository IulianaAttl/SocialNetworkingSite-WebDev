# SocialNetworkingSite-WebDev

An online social network for over 70s who wish to share online with others their age. Users first create accounts entering their name and contact details. Users login using their email and password. When they log in, each user must complete a Covid check-in where they answer the following questions: 

1.What is your temperature? 
2. Can you breathe easily? 
3. Do you have a cough? 
4. Have you lost or had a change in your sense of smell? 

If temperature is 38.0 or above, or if “yes” is answered to any of the questions the user is brought to a page that says “Please contact your GP to investigate your symptoms further and self isolate”. If no symptoms are present and temp is below 38.0 then the user can progress. 

-	Users can view all other users in the system and can add a user as a friend. 
-	They are able to see all their own friends separately. 
-	They can view their own and others’ profile pages.
-	Each user has their own profile page, where they can write a post. 
-	They can also write/comment on their friends’ profile page. 
-	Users are only able to conduct all above when logged in and should be able to log out.
